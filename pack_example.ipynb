      "The people of the land were devastated by this tragedy. They didn’t know what to do next. Then they remembered that the older prince had left behind a beautiful daughter. She was kind-hearted and wise beyond her years. So they crowned her as queen. Under her rule, the kingdom flourished once again. And so it came to pass that goodness triumphed over evil.\n",

      "Once upon a time, there lived a shepherd boy who tended his flock at pasture. One day, he disliked his work and decided to play a prank on the villagers. He shouted, “Wolf! Wolf!” This caused great panic among the villagers. They dropped whatever they were doing and ran towards the pasture to help the boy drive away the wolf. When they reached the spot, however, they found no wolf. The boy laughed at them and said, “April Fool!”\n",
      "But when the wolf really appeared a few days later, the boy cried out for help. However, nobody paid any attention to his cries because they thought it was another one of his jokes. The poor boy lost all his sheep to the hungry wolf. From then onwards, whenever the boy cried out, “Wolf,” nobody listened to him anymore. Moral: Don’t tell lies or you will lose credibility.\n",

But after some distance, Hare got tired and fell asleep under a tree. Meanwhile, Tortoise kept walking steadily until he finally reached the finish line and won the race.\n",

Her mother warned her not to stray off the path and to beware of wolves that might come up to her. She set off into the forest and came across a wolf who tricked her by pretending to be lost like her. He told her where her grandmother’s house was located and persuaded her to pick flowers for her sick granny. While she did so, the sneaky wolf made his way towards the old woman’s cottage. When Little Red Riding Hood arrived at her grandmother’s place, she found the door open and the bed empty. The wolf had eaten her grandmother and disguised himself as her. However, when the little girl realized what happened, she shouted loudly which scared away the wolf. A woodcutter passing by heard her cry and rescued her. Moral: Don’t talk to strangers or you may get hurt.\n",

Enraged at this news, the queen ordered her henchmen to kill Snow White and bring back her heart as proof. However, the guards took pity on the young girl and let her go into the woods. There, she met seven dwarfs who allowed her to stay with them. The jealous queen disguised herself several times but failed each time to poison Snow White.

But one night, the king announced that he would hold a grand ball where his son, the prince, would choose his bride. All the eligible maidens were invited. When Cinderella’s stepmother refused to allow her to attend, she cried bitterly.

The old couple was overjoyed and named him Hansel. As years passed by, the brother and sister grew up to be strong and healthy children. However, when times became hard due to famine, their parents could no longer afford to feed them. So one night, while their father slept, their mother led them deep into the woods where she left them alone with nothing but some breadcrumbs to follow home. But when Hansel woke up, he found that birds had eaten all the crumbs and they were lost in the forest. Luckily, they came across a cottage inhabited by an old woman who took pity on them and let them stay. When their parents realized what happened, they searched everywhere for them.
